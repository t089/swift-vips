# Implementation Summary: VIPS Complex and Statistical Operations

## Date: 2025-08-20

### Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive support for VIPS complex number operations, statistical operations, and band operations in the SwiftVIPS library.

## Implemented Operations

### Complex Number Operations (Lines 1354-1514)
All complex number operations have been implemented in `Sources/VIPS/Arithmetic/operators.swift`:

- ✅ `complex(_:)` - Combine real and imaginary images into complex
- ✅ `complexform(_:)` - Alias for complex() matching libvips naming
- ✅ `complex(_:)` - Perform complex operations (polar, rect, conj)
- ✅ `polar()` - Convert complex to polar form
- ✅ `rect()` - Convert polar to rectangular form
- ✅ `conj()` - Complex conjugate
- ✅ `complexget(_:)` - Extract component with operation type
- ✅ `real()` - Extract real part
- ✅ `imag()` - Extract imaginary part
- ✅ `complex2(_:operation:)` - Binary complex operations
- ✅ `crossPhase(_:)` - Cross-phase calculation

### Statistical Operations (Lines 1516-1657)
Comprehensive statistical operations implemented:

- ✅ `sum(_:)` - Static method to sum array of images
- ✅ `stats()` - Calculate comprehensive statistics
- ✅ `measure(h:v:)` - Measure labeled regions
- ✅ `profile()` - Extract row and column profiles
- ✅ `project()` - Project rows and columns to get sums

Verified existing implementations:
- ✅ `avg()` - Average of all pixels (line 152)
- ✅ `deviate()` - Standard deviation (line 165)
- ✅ `min()` - Minimum value (line 139)
- ✅ `max()` - Maximum value (line 126)

### Band Operations (Lines 1659-1715)
Bitwise operations across image bands:

- ✅ `bandand()` - Bitwise AND across bands
- ✅ `bandor()` - Bitwise OR across bands
- ✅ `bandeor()` - Bitwise XOR across bands

## Test Coverage
Added comprehensive tests in `Tests/VIPSTests/ArithmeticOperationsTests.swift`:

- Complex operations tests (lines 721-800)
  - testComplexForm()
  - testPolarAndRect()
  - testComplexConjugate()
  - testRealAndImag()

- Statistical operations tests (lines 802-873)
  - testSum()
  - testSumSingleImage()
  - testStats()
  - testProfile()
  - testProject()

- Band operations tests (lines 875-905)
  - testBandAnd()
  - testBandOr()
  - testBandEor()

## API Verification
All implementations have been verified against:
- System libvips headers in `/usr/include/vips/`
- Function signatures match the C API exactly
- Corrected `profile()` to return both columns and rows as per libvips API

## Code Quality
- ✅ Follows Swift naming conventions
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation for all methods
- ✅ Function overloading instead of `_const` suffixes
- ✅ Proper error handling with VIPSError
- ✅ Consistent with existing codebase patterns

## Files Modified
1. `Sources/VIPS/Arithmetic/operators.swift` - Added 361 lines of implementation
2. `Tests/VIPSTests/ArithmeticOperationsTests.swift` - Added 186 lines of tests
3. `docs/operations_todo.md` - Updated to mark completed operations

## Dependencies
Utilizes existing enum types:
- `VipsOperationComplex` (polar, rect, conj)
- `VipsOperationComplexget` (real, imag)
- `VipsOperationComplex2` (crossPhase)

## Notes
- The `profile()` function was corrected to match the libvips API signature which returns both columns and rows
- All complex operations handle both rectangular and polar representations
- Statistical operations support multi-band images appropriately
- Band operations reduce multi-band images to single-band results

```

#### class VIPSBlob

```swift
public final class VIPSBlob: Collection, ExpressibleByArrayLiteral, Sendable, SendableMetatype, Sequence {
  /// The number of elements in the collection.
  /// 
  /// To check whether a collection is empty, use its `isEmpty` property
  /// instead of comparing `count` to zero. Unless the collection guarantees
  /// random-access performance, calculating `count` can be an O(*n*)
  /// operation.
  /// 
  /// - Complexity: O(1) if the collection conforms to
  ///   `RandomAccessCollection`; otherwise, O(*n*), where *n* is the length
  ///   of the collection.
  public var count: Int { get }

  /// A textual representation of this instance, suitable for debugging.
  /// 
  /// Calling this property directly is discouraged. Instead, convert an
  /// instance of any type to a string by using the `String(reflecting:)`
  /// initializer. This initializer works with any type, and uses the custom
  /// `debugDescription` property for types that conform to
  /// `CustomDebugStringConvertible`:
  /// 
  ///     struct Point: CustomDebugStringConvertible {
  ///         let x: Int, y: Int
  /// 
  ///         var debugDescription: String {
  ///             return "(\(x), \(y))"
  ///         }
  ///     }

  ///     let p = Point(x: 21, y: 30)
  ///     let s = String(reflecting: p)
  ///     print(s)
  ///     // Prints "(21, 30)"

  /// The conversion of `p` to a string in the assignment to `s` uses the
  /// `Point` type's `debugDescription` property.
  public var debugDescription: String { get }

  /// The collection's "past the end" position---that is, the position one
  /// greater than the last valid subscript argument.
  /// 
  /// When you need a range that includes the last element of a collection, use
  /// the half-open range operator (`..<`) with `endIndex`. The `..<` operator
  /// creates a range that doesn't include the upper bound, so it's always
  /// safe to use with `endIndex`. For example:
  /// 
  ///     let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
  ///     if let index = numbers.firstIndex(of: 30) {
  ///         print(numbers[index ..< numbers.endIndex])
  ///     }
  ///     // Prints "[30, 40, 50]"

  /// If the collection is empty, `endIndex` is equal to `startIndex`.

/// - **Memory targets**: Store output in memory, accessible via steal() methods
/// - **Pipe targets**: Support only sequential writing, suitable for streaming
/// - **Custom targets**: Behavior depends on the custom implementation

#### class VIPSTargetCustom

```swift
/// A custom VIPSTarget that allows you to implement your own write behavior.
/// 
/// This class provides a way to create targets with custom write, seek, and
/// read implementations. You can use this to write to custom destinations
/// like network streams, compressed files, or any other custom storage.
/// 
/// # Usage Example
/// 
/// ```swift
/// let customTarget = VIPSTargetCustom()
/// 
/// // Set up write handler
/// customTarget.onWrite { bytes in
///     // Write bytes to your custom destination
///     // Return the number of bytes actually written
///     return writeToCustomDestination(bytes)
/// }
/// 
/// // Set up end handler (replaces deprecated finish)
/// customTarget.onEnd {
///     // Finalize your custom destination
///     finalizeCustomDestination()
///     return 0  // 0 for success
/// }
/// 
/// // For seekable custom targets, also implement:
/// customTarget.onSeek { offset, whence in
///     return seekInCustomDestination(offset, whence)
/// }
/// 
/// customTarget.onRead { length in
///     return readFromCustomDestination(length)
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// # Callback Requirements
/// 
/// - **Write callback**: Must consume as many bytes as possible and return the actual count
/// - **End callback**: Should finalize the destination and release resources
/// - **Seek callback**: Should change position and return new absolute position (-1 for error)
/// - **Read callback**: Should read up to the requested bytes and return actual data read
